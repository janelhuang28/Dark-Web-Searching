# Dark-Web-Searching
Tutorial on searching on the dark web as following the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbI-OSRr8kg&ab_channel=Hakin9Media. Note that this should be searched with care as a misconduct can lead to legal issues and potential virus infection!

## Onion Search
Onion search is still one of the sites that are still open to search on the web. 
1. Type https://onionlandsearchengine.com/
2. Type a search e.g. ``amazon`` - this could potentially leak the amazon gift cards that are sold illegally

## Ahmia
Ahmia is another dark web search engine. This can be visited via: https://ahmia.fi/ 
Again we can see the amazon gift cards that are sold:

Note that for both Ahmia and Onion search, the links will need to be in a TOR session or browser to access.
