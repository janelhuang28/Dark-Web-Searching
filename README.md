# Dark-Web-Searching
Tutorial on searching on the dark web as following the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbI-OSRr8kg&ab_channel=Hakin9Media. Note that this should be searched with care as a misconduct can lead to legal issues and potential virus infection!

## Onion Search
Onion search is still one of the sites that are still open to search on the web. 
1. Type https://onionlandsearchengine.com/
2. Type a search e.g. ``amazon`` - this could potentially leak the amazon gift cards that are sold illegally

## Ahmia
Ahmia is another dark web search engine. This can be visited via: https://ahmia.fi/ 
Again we can see the amazon gift cards that are sold:

Note that for both Ahmia and Onion search, the links will need to be in a TOR session or browser to access.

## Install TOR
TOR is a onion browser that allows you to privately surf the Internet. The browser works by routing requests to 3 different servers consecutively so our source cannot be traced back. The last server sends the traffic to the public Internet.
1. Download TOR here: https://www.torproject.org/download/
2. For Kali, download Linux version
3. Extract files and open terminal
4. Run ``./start-tor-browser.desktop --register-app`` to register the application to our desktop applications
5. Run the TOR browser by typing in TOR in the application search bar or through ``./start-tor-browser.desktop``

## Hidden Wiki
The hidden wiki is the main page of the dark web. This can be found by typing in ``the hidden wiki`` or visiting https://thehiddenwiki.com/
An example page of the hidden wiki

### Onion links

This page provides links for alleged passports, breaches, leaked passwords, drugs, etc. 

# Remarks

It is important to note that the dark web should be serached in a careful manner, avoiding any chances of information leakage and legal issues. It is hard for government agencies to get to the dark web because the sites are constantly changing, thus harder to track the domain name. The purpose of this experiement is to identify the ways in which a black hat hacker may conduct illegal activity. Identifying the ways in which the dark web is searched can help in forensics analysis and traceability.
